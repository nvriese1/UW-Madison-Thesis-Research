function Z_f = detrend_2d(Z)

%This function is written by Munther Gdeisat-The General Engineering

%This function is the 2D equivalent of detrend function in Matlab
%  Z_f = DETREND(Z) removes the best plane fit trend from the
%     data in the 2D array Z and returns the residual in the 2D array Z_f

M = size(Z,2);
N = size(Z,1);
[X,Y] = meshgrid(1:M,1:N);

%Make the 2D data as 1D vector
Xcolv = X(:); % Make X a column vector
Ycolv = Y(:); % Make Y a column vector
Zcolv = Z(:); % Make Z a column vector
Const = ones(size(Xcolv)); % Vector of ones for constant term

% find the coeffcients of the best plane fit
Coefficients = [Xcolv Ycolv Const]\Zcolv; % Find the coefficients
XCoeff = Coefficients(1); % X coefficient
YCoeff = Coefficients(2); % X coefficient
CCoeff = Coefficients(3); % constant term

% detrend the data
Z_p = XCoeff * X + YCoeff * Y + CCoeff;
Z_f = Z - Z_p;
